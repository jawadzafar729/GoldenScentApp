Design Test application with complicated UI

I have divided the screen into three fragment/subscreens. Here is how it look like

I left the font and other minor thing due to time shortage. I have created this application on my Samsung Galaxy J5. It should work 
okay on other divices as I try to make views compatible to all screens. Minor issue might be there. Thanks
